theGallery
===========
Online automated art gallery based on your search input.

Want an automatically created gallery of your favorite artist?

This program is based on two programs. A python web scraper, that gets the images of your favorite artist from http://www.metmuseum.org/collection/the-collection-online, and a webGL/ThreeJs application that dynamically makes your own art gallery.

HOW TO:
#In the console at the main directory:
cd python
python downloader.py 
cd ..
node server.js

Then go to your browser and your gallery is on your localhost.

I need sleep.
